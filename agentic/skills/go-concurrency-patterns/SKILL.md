# Go Concurrency Patterns

Production patterns for Go concurrency including goroutines, channels, synchronization primitives, and context management.

## Use this skill when

- Building concurrent Go applications
- Implementing worker pools and pipelines
- Managing goroutine lifecycles
- Using channels for communication
- Debugging race conditions
- Implementing graceful shutdown

## Do not use this skill when

- The task is unrelated to go concurrency patterns
- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope

## Instructions

- Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
- Provide actionable steps and verification.
- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

## Resources

- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed patterns and examples.
